    <h1>Hello there ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <h2>I'm DÃ¡vid, a mathematics student from Hungary.</h2>
    <h3>Math</h3>
    <p>Besides my duties at the university I study elliptic curves and regular trees.</p>
    <h3>Programming</h3>
    <p>As one of the founders of Algo Pro Club, I mentor high-school students in weekly online programming classes.</p>
    <p>I really enjoy game development, just as competitive programming. Topped with SFML, C++ is my loved one.
        Check out my projects on <a href="https://github.com/meljandavid">GitHub</a>, you may find there something interesting.</p>
    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>I like cars so much that I started to model my city centre to race at. In another (not so distant) universe I would definitely were to flat out some corners regularly.</p>
    <p>I grew up with a massive enthusiasm towards technology, I used to make vlogs and even some shortfilms. My gallery of insanely artistic photos is still growing.</p>
    <p>It doesn't matter whether it's the virtual streets of Miami or a pleasant Cafehouse in Russia, I am ready to do some laps in Assetto Corsa or defuse a bomb with my friends in R6.
        By the way I had been making strategies and leading an esport team for years, something that I am missing these days.</p>
    <p>Sometimes I play in the national 2nd league, however recently one can find me online playing chess.</p>
    <p>I was pretty young when I started playing football as a goalkeeper, after a short (6 years of basketball) break I continued keeping the net safe.
        If no one's around to score some goals, I hop on my Scott to cicle around the dunes of KecskemÃ©t.</p>
